## Lyrics

MOTHNODE_ Beast 

RHYME some something phat stacks homin' tagged 

something RHYME some's poppin' peripherals off  13

some something RHYME target track choosing does

something RHYME something one brag they'll stand (do) without

RHYME something something this is us droppin' bass 

something RHYME something all perspectives wide on ours, 

something something RHYME we've already seen'em closed

something RHYME something cover often just to open eyes


MIST fast approaching phat stacks homin' tagged 

fear the BEAST inside poppin' peripherals off  13
there's one thing i MISSED target track choosing DOES
hear them FEAST on one brag they'll do without yeah

HIT and crash this test this is us droppin' bass anew
- GIVES us wrath, all perspectives wide on ours 
much too late to catch a DRIFT we've already seen'em close (?)
hide in HINTS master covert up, just not the eyes
cover often just to open eyes

- here goes why? 15

can't get a timeline by choosing rhymes
do i have to describe red lining findings i defined 
cut threads burnt through several times
been wasting so much life for one sole purpose 
first to actually live them through
to make me see the lies

to know when you can't and won't shouldn't do
then to make them fuel

for expelling the self-hatred that's you're feeling sure 
roll up your stage, in the future you are done
coming from the future times, 
been out and about with our minds 
came back urgent yet disaligned, 
surging with the current crowd
with the flaws attack and arise, 
they make you defined
ready to go the distance
got visions but too distant
we are hitech crime

```

## Music Video

MIST FAST APPROACHING 
PHAT STACKS HOMIN’ TAGGED
FEAR THE BEAST INSIDE 
POPPING PERIPHERALS OFF

THERE IS ONE CLUE I MISSED
TARGET TRACKING CHOOSING DOES
HEAR THEM FEAST,
ONE BRAG THEY’LL DO WITHOUT

HIT AND CRASH THIS TEST
THIS IS US DROPPING BASS ANEW
GIVES A US WRATH
ALL PERSPECTIVES WIDE ON OURS

MUCH TOO LATE TO CATCH A DRIFT 
WE’VE ALREADY SEEN THEM CLOSE
HIDE IN HINTS MASTER COVER UP
JUST NOT THE EYES

Fellow Operative @blckbrd.ca sharing his thoughts on Hitech Crime Cinematic Narrative Universe Microlabel I’ve been developing for 2 years now. 

Coming from the Helve AVR rogue creative agency or a one man army (whichever version you prefer), Hitech Crime is a longterm endeavour. In its core it is a transmedia metabrand mixing together filmmaking, animation, gamified interactive digital and augmented live experiences, written stories, lore and dark emotional music.

All of my Operatives (creators) and Agents (audience) - people who’ve been with me throughout the years are the ones that are actually making it a reality and I want to thank you for that. It gives credibility to my visions and enforces my purpose.

Stay in contact with the HQ and please do subscribe to our YouTube broadcast platform if you want to become an active part of our semi-fictional universe.
